Welcome to the first MarTech newsletter. Each month(or so) we will send an email with some of the latest projects and products we have been working on across the company in hopes that you will find value at your resort as well.  If you are interested in taking advantage of any of items presented, just let us know and we will do our best to bring it to your resort. Additionally we pick out some interesting industry news we find relevant to our business.

If you have something to contribute that all resorts can benefit from in the Marketing Technology space please let us know and we will try to include it in the next edition.



## Text Emergency Alerts

![SOS Test Page](/assets/images/sos.png)

A new feature has been added to the Quick Trax Snow and Lift reporting app that allows Ski Patrol and Risk and Safety teams to easily text message different notification groups with one simple website, which helps in vastly reducing the need for call trees in order to notify relevant staff members of incidents. This is currently rolling out at Winter Park as this idea came from Will Tien, a Safety Specialist there, but is ready to go for any resort interested. If you would like to learn more, or get starting using this for your internal risk and safety alerts, please reach out to Steven Hubert for details and to get you resort set up! 


## 3D / VR Lodging Tours

We recently acquired a new 360/VR camera by Matterport that allows us to create 3D tours of our lodging properties so that our customers can find and remember the perfect room for their vacation. Tours have already been created at Winter Park and Steamboat, and if you are interested in getting tours for your properties, please reach out to Steven Hubert and he can get it scheduled with your mountain properties. As a bonus, the 360 views can be embedded in Facebook, or viewed through Samsung VR or Google Cardboard for a more immersive experience. 




## Email Database Stats and Benchmarking

![Sample Dashboard](/assets/images/dashboard.png)

Two new interactive emails dashboards have been created and deployed that let you compare your metrics to other Intrawest resorts and overall industry standards as well as providing a deep dive into your specific success campaigns successes. Using data straight from the source provides an easy, accurate at glance view for tracking your campaigns success at glance or with senior leadership. If you have questions or idea’s to make the dashboards even more effective for your resort please reach out to Greg Arnold.

## Website Heat-mapping via HotJar

![Sample Heatmap](/assets/images/heatmap-469979-movement-desktop-2.jpg)

We have had this tool for some time now, but it is worth reminding those that know about it and introducing those that don’t. HotJar is a tool that tracks users behaviors on a specific page, both clicks and scrolls, to get an idea of what content on your page is getting the most attention. This is helpful for optimizing the page hierarchy to determine which CTA have the most attention or determining if the content is interesting enough for a customer to scroll. If your resort has a page, or 10, that it interesting in testing please get in touch with Ryan Dobbins or Miriam Schachtman.

 
## Trust You Reviews

![Sample Review](/assets/images/grandtrustyou.png)

As many of the former Intrawest resorts already know we traded in Trip Advisor lodging reviews for reviews from Trust You. Cost aside there were many reasons for doing this including that Trust You includes reviews from Trip Advisor and 100 other review sites such as Yelp, AirBnb and Hotels.com. A much larger cannon of reviews ensures more fairness to the reviews and it doesn’t route our lodging leads to Trip Advisor for the sale. We ran an extensive A/B test across a number of resorts and saw that we were losing considerable revenue to Trip Advisor. With TrustYou this is no longer a problem. If you are interested in learning more about TrustYou for a possible integration on your resorts web properties or emails please reach out to Steven Hubert for details.
